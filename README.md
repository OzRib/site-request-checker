# Why it has been buit?
  This application is buit to check the status of a site.<br>
  I have buit this to check if a service what I use is running.<br>
  The service dropped and I built this to check when he came back.<br>

  clone this repository in your machine and enter in project repository:<br>

```
git clone https://github.com/OzRib/site-request-checker.git
cd site-request-checker

sudo apt install python python-tkinter
```

# How to use?

run the script with python machine and put the site url and the status wanted to this site.<br>
Example:
```
 python main.py https://github.com 200
```

when the site is running correctly a window open to notify you.<br>
This is all :)
